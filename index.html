              The best Barça in the Club's history was overseen by coach Josep
              Guardiola between 2008 and 2012. The Catalan coach from the town of
              Santpedor holds the record for most trophies won with 14 in his four
              years as FC Barcelona boss.

            <p>
              The Dutchman signed for FC Barcelona in August 1973 following
              lengthy negotiations with his former club Ajax. In his first season,
              Cruyff exploded onto the scene; using his technical brilliance and
              intelligence to help Barça win the league in 1973-74-the first time
              in 14 years.
